My name is Britney Lozza. I have the following qualities:

- I enjoy video games, my favourite is the Mass Effect series and Grand Theft Auto 5 Online.
- I'm an expert with computers. I run Linux instead of Windows or MacOS.
- I'm transgender, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and a genius.
- I write code in markdown which is a programming language for outputting documents.

What else do you need?

### My story

After a long career of 15 years working with computers, I transitioned from male to female. During my transition I 
experienced a lot of hate and ridicule. As a result, I became interested in law. I'm a natural at it. I've successfully negotiated settlements from numerous respondents via the HRTO. I've won an OLRB case as well. Details can be found in my CV.

### My legal victory

### My Code

<a href="https://github.com/BritneyLozza/legal-precedents">Coded Legal Precedent Letters</a>
- Uses markdown and pandoc to generate legal precent letters through markdown code.
- This is genius level stuff, requires Linux and programming skills.
